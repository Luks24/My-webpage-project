Since I was little, I was always interested in technology and liked to tinker with hardware. Because of that reason, when I finished high school, I went to a civil engineering college, but after a year in it, It didn’t feel right to me, and I missed the practical aspect of building things. So after that year, I took 1 year to really discover what I want to do. In that time, I discovered programming, or should I say that I delved deeper into it. This ignited a spark in me, so next year I went to do my bachelor's in computer science and web development. After that, I had the option to also do my master's, and **_I became the first to finish the new master's program at my university._** 

## Starting my career 🖥️

While I was finishing my bachelor's, I got my first real job as a QA engineer at a startup. There, they needed someone who could program to automate their testing and also do some programming for proof-of-concept projects. Basically, since it was a startup, I did a lot of everything, which made me realise that what I really like is to understand the base layer of how things work. This also sparked my interest in systems and how they work.

After that, I started working for the investor in the former startup since they needed someone with my skills. Here, I started to work with cloud providers like Azure and dug deeper into work as a system engineer. Here is also where I learned how to work for a bigger company and how to communicate effectively with people.

My next step was as an APM consultant for AppDynamics, which was the solution CISCO had for Application performance monitoring. Here, I had the chance to dig deeper into monitoring tools as well as operating systems. What I learned the most, though, is how to work with customers and how to effectively communicate with them. It also broadened my horizon and knowledge of other cultures since I had customers from all over the world.

But after a while, I missed doing more technical work, so I joined a company where I worked as a subcontractor for HPE. This was my first experience where I worked for a Fortune 500 company and where I thoroughly saw how big a scale this is. I was part of the DevOps team, where we were mostly working on migrating the system to a new platform.

After the project ended, I joined my current company, CargoX, where I am part of a DevOps/SRE team. Here, my focus shifted more to Kubernetes and AWS. I also deployed a lot of monitoring solutions and helped with processes.

Last year, I also started to offer my knowledge part-time on other projects, so if you want to work with me, feel free to contact me.


## Other interests in my life  💡

So while I am not deep into solving technology issues, one of the things I like to do is to move my body any way possible. I did everything from training in basketball, going to the gym, and climbing. To combat sports like Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Most of my movement now comes from training in the gym and going climbing.

I also like to read and have amassed quite a collection of books. The genres I like range from pure technical, political, and philosophical to more relaxed ones like fantasy, sci-fi, and manga. I also like to collect classical books and prefer the physical ones to reading on Kindle.

Other than that, like most people, I like to listen to music, where I prefer older songs from the 60s and 70s as well as classical music. I also like to make great espresso at home (one of the trendy hobbies you get after 30).

God knows what will be the next hobby I pick up.

##  Other fields I worked in 🤖

Since I am also working part-time, I have started working with a robotics company where I would build custom images for the Raspberry Pi. Doing this has also rekindled the feeling from my childhood, where I would take things apart and play with them.

I also do some small projects for my personal use that I will describe and share with people in the future on my page here.

Oh yeah, modifying this astro template from a GitHub project has also brought back memories from my first days as a developer ( and also CSS nightmares), but I think that for now it has turned out pretty good.
