I started developing my first commercial projects as a web developer in 2017. Although I've been passionate about technology for as long as I can remember. I discovered the internet at age 6, and along with it, I learned to use **Paint** 🎨 and play **Pinball** on a **Windows XP** computer that my cousins had. Years passed, and I discovered there was a cyber café near my house, so accompanied by my older brother, I spent a lot of time there, watching others play **Age of Empires** ⚔️. When I could, I also played on the computers and investigated how those games worked. But above all, I remember that while sitting there, I watched the owner, Alfredo, the good <a href="https://fred.cpp.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred</a>, while he programmed and modeled game maps, or at least that's what I remember. That made me want to try doing the same. I found it incredible how so many things happened on his screen that, although I couldn't understand them, looked amazing. Without a doubt, he was my first influence to get into programming.

When we got our first computer at home, around 2011, I spent all my time there, creating my own texture packs to integrate them into one of the games I played the most: **GTA SA**. For this, I learned to use **GIMP** and later **Photoshop**. I wanted to go further and started creating scenarios for the game, so that's when I learned 3D modeling. By then, I was already 12 years old, and I remember I had the intention of dedicating myself to creating video games 🎮. A couple of years later, knowing that programming is needed to create video games, I researched a bit and created my first website with **HTML 4** and **CSS3**. It was a static page, clearly not responsive, and its design and content were very poor, but I felt very proud seeing my page working online.

## My Beginnings in Programming 🖥️

In 2014, I entered high school and decided to take the Programming Technician career. In the first semester, as an integral project, I knew I wanted to make a video game, so I committed to doing it. I learned to use **Unity**, delved deeper into **Blender**, and a bit into **C#**. It was an arduous process, as no one on my team knew how to program, but with their help, we all learned a bit more and managed to complete the project. We delivered a functional demo of a character in a scenario in our 3D _survival_ type game. It was at that moment that I discovered that making a video game is not easy at all and understood the magnitude of knowledge, time, and dedication needed.

I felt good about having achieved that small project, but gradually I fell more in love with web design and development. So, I started learning more about **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I spent all my free time watching courses and practicing on fictional sites that I designed.

## The World of Robotics 🤖

In high school, a teacher and good friend, **Esteban Ángeles**, recruited me to belong to the school's robotics team, which competed in <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VEX Robotics</a> tournaments. He saw me while I was designing a "3D spider robot" in **Autodesk Inventor**, so I was able to integrate more friends into the team. One of them was <a href="https://github.com/erikestr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erik Alejandro Estrada Sauza</a>, someone with the same drive and curiosity as me. I was the robot designer, and he programmed it. Along with the rest of the team, we built it. It was a very fun experience full of learning.

In 2015, thanks to teacher Esteban, I was invited to take an **Autodesk Inventor** course for a week in another city, offered directly by **Autodesk**. At that time, the need arose in the team to get a 3D printer to further improve the functioning of our robot, so we started researching and trying to manufacture our own 3D printer. During that process, we discovered **Kickstarter** and ventured to try to publish a 3D printing project.

## Exploring Crowdfunding 💡

We discovered that in Mexico there was **_Fondeadora_**, a platform similar to Kickstarter. Coincidentally, both platforms were about to merge and, as we had a draft project on Kickstarter, we were invited to the merger event between Fondeadora and Kickstarter. Additionally, we participated in the _<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/willburgm/100-kickstarter-dreams-the-voice-of-100-creators#react-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Make/100 Kickstarter Dreams - The Voice of 100 Creators</a>_ project, an e-book with a compilation of 100 creators sharing their experience and knowledge gained in their campaigns. There I appeared representing my team as one of the 100 creators.
